##Representation of terms

###Constants

Constant "name_of_constant"

Example: Constant `a` is represented as `Constant "a"`.

###Variables

Variable "name_of_variable"

Example: Variable `X` is represented as `Variable "X"`.

###Functions

Function "function_name" arity [term_1, term_2, ... , term_n]

Example: Function `f (a, X)` is represented as `Function "f" 2 [Constant "a" , Varriable "X"]`

Example: Function `g ()`, which has no argument, is represented as `Function "g" 0 []`

Example: Function `f (g (y), Y )` is represented as `Function "f" 1 [Function "g" 1 [Constant "y"] , Variable "Y"]`

###Equations

(term_1 , term_2)

Example: f (a) = f (X) is represented as `(Function "f" 1 [Constant "a"], Function "f" 1 [Variable "X"])`

###Multiset of Equations 
[(term_1,term_2),(term_3,term_4)....]

Example: `{a = X, Y = b, Z = X}` is represented as 

`[(Constant "a",Variable "X"), (Variable "Y",Constant "b"),(Variable "Z",Variable "X")]`
